A custom, low-profile mechanical keyboard that doesn't require any cable management, no hassles with batteries, or any portability problems. I plan to use ZMK for firmware once I get the pcb assembled, and I will update this README when I 
make it. I'm planning to make the case in Shapr3D when I get it as well, but I already started some of it. Instead of having an extra row of keys for function keys, which will sacrifice portability, I decided to instead have small rotary
encoders that will control the brightness, and the volume seperately. The whole keyboard is going to be made using surface mount technology, and the PCB was made in kicad. Here are images of the
